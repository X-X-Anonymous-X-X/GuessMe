# GuessMe
A number guessing python program


This program simply prompts user to guess a number between 1 to 10 ; then program displays list of numbers and asks the user to verify the number existence in the provided list. Based on the user response after 1..5 tries ,program guesses the number ; somewhat removing and increasing probability !

Code is not written w.r.t efficiency !
